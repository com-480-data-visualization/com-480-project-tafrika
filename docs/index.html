                    compare players across a wide range of offensive and defensive metrics, providing a clear picture of who dominates the
                    court. Picture yourself evaluating the scoring efficiency of guards like James Harden against the defensive prowess of
                    forwards like Kawhi Leonard, all in one dynamic chart.
